# Smart Factory Simulation

This project simulates a smart factory environment using .NET and C#. It models tasks such as production tracking and inventory management with a focus on object-oriented principles and SQL database interactions.

## Features
- Simulation of factory production tasks and inventory management.
- Basic object-oriented structure to represent factory processes.
- SQL database integration for data persistence.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <your_repo_url>`
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred .NET IDE.
3. Update the SQL connection string in `appsettings.json`.
4. Build and run the application.

## Key Components
- **Production Simulation**: Simulates production cycles and tracks output rates.
- **Inventory Management**: Manages inventory levels and updates based on simulated usage.
- **SQL Database**: Persists production and inventory data for reporting.
